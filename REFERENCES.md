## 2. Modding framework and libraries

| Source | Version | Where it comes from | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BepInEx 5 LTS** — the build Valheim uses, and the one this mod compiles against: <https://github.com/AzumattDev/BepInEx> (branch **`v5-lts`**, maintained by Azumatt) | pack **5.4.2350** = assembly **5.4.23.5** (`BepInEx.dll`, `BepInEx.Harmony.dll`; built from commit `ef506e0a`, *"Bump ThunderStore version to 5.4.2350"*) | `denikson-BepInExPack_Valheim-5.4.2350` (Thunderstore); `.references/BepInEx/5.4.2350/BepInEx/core/` | Plugin/base framework, `ConfigFile`/`ConfigEntry`/`ConfigDescription`, config reload + `SettingChanged` events |
| **BepInEx** (upstream 5.x line) — <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx> | 5.4.x (EOL) | Cite reference only | Historical/API reference; **not** the source of the pack we build against — see the note below this table |
| **HarmonyX** — <https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX> | 2.9.0 (`0Harmony.dll`) | BepInEx pack / `packages.config` reference | All runtime patches (`Patches/*`) |
| **Jötunn (Jotunn)** — <https://github.com/ValheimModding/Jotunn> | 2.30.2 | NuGet package `JotunnLib` 2.30.2 (`packages.config`); <https://www.nuget.org/packages/JotunnLib> | Mod-framework helpers; **`Jotunn.Managers.SynchronizationManager`** (ServerSync), `SynchronizationModeAttribute` + `AdminOnlyStrictness`, `NetworkCompatibility`, `GUIManager.IsHeadless()`, `MinimapManager`, `ConfigEntryBaseExtension` |
| **Vapok.Valheim.Common** — <https://github.com/Vapok/Vapok.Common> | NuGet 3.21.1015 (assembly 2.11.2214.0) | NuGet; <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vapok.Valheim.Common> | **No longer used (removed in 3.0.0)** — the assembly reference, its `packages.config` entry and its ILRepack merge were all dropped: the splash modal (`ModSplashManager`/`ModSplashDossier`), the `TelemetryManager` (anonymous usage events and error reporting) and the last remaining usage (`Vapok.Common.Shared.ConfigurationManagerAttributes`) are gone, the two local preferences now using Jotunn's `ConfigurationManagerAttributes`, which the server-owned entries already used. Recorded here because versions up to 2.6.0 shipped it merged into the mod DLL |
| **Official BepInEx ConfigurationManager** — <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager> | source @ `master`, read 2026-09-28 | Cite reference only | The in-game config UI. Resolves an attributes class **by type name** (not assembly identity); its own `internal sealed` class defines `Order`, `ReadOnly`, `IsAdvanced`, `Browsable`, `Category`, `CustomDrawer`, `CustomHotkeyDrawer`, `DispName`, `Description`, `HideDefaultButton`, `HideSettingName`, `DefaultValue`, `ShowRangeAsPercent`, `ObjToStr`, `StrToObj` — and **no** admin concept |

### Which BepInEx build this mod compiles against

Valheim's BepInEx is **not** built from <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx> (that 5.x line is EOL). The
`denikson-BepInExPack_Valheim` pack ships a maintenance build from
**<https://github.com/AzumattDev/BepInEx>** — branch **`v5-lts`** (a second branch, `TSChanges`, carries the
Thunderstore packaging). Verified 2026-09-29:

- `Directory.Build.props` on `v5-lts` declares `<BepInExVersionPrefix>5.4.23.5</BepInExVersionPrefix>`.
- The pack names that same build **`5.4.2350`**, and the `BepInEx.dll` in
  `.references/BepInEx/5.4.2350/BepInEx/core/` reports file/product version
  `5.4.23.5+ef506e0a6bb98c49d85b7927b5ab625605826be0`.
- That commit (`ef506e0a`) resolves **only** in `AzumattDev/BepInEx` — its message is literally
  *"Bump ThunderStore version to 5.4.2350"* — and does not exist upstream
  (`GET /repos/BepInEx/BepInEx/commits/ef506e0a…` → HTTP 422).
- The fork's `BepInEx.csproj` pins `HarmonyX` **2.9.0**, matching the `0Harmony.dll` 2.9.0 listed above.

So <https://github.com/AzumattDev/BepInEx> (branch `v5-lts`) is the exact upstream source of the framework
this mod is compiled and shipped against.

### Notes on the ConfigurationManager / ServerSync behaviour

The ConfigurationManager implementation was read from its **source** (fetched 2026-09-28 — see §7), together with offline primary sources:

- ConfigurationManager resolves the attributes class **by type name**, and copies only the fields whose
  names match its own (`ConfigurationManager.Shared/SettingEntryBase.cs`):

  ```csharp
  var attrType = attrib.GetType();
  if (attrType.Name == "ConfigurationManagerAttributes")
  {
      var otherFields = attrType.GetFields(BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public);
      foreach (var propertyPair in _myProperties.Join(otherFields, my => my.Name, other => other.Name, ...))
  ```

  Extra fields are ignored rather than rejected — which is exactly why Jötunn, Vapok.Common and blaxxun's
  ServerSync can each ship their own copy of the class.
- ConfigurationManager's own class has **no** `IsAdminOnly` and **no** `IsUnlocked`; a search for
  `Unlocked|IsAdmin|AdminOnly` across its whole source returns nothing. Both fields belong to the
  **sync library**: Jötunn's public `ConfigurationManagerAttributes` carries
  `IsAdminOnly`/`IsUnlocked`, and `Jotunn.Managers.SynchronizationManager` reads them back with
  `OfType<ConfigurationManagerAttributes>()` (Jötunn's own type).
- **Consequence for this mod:** server-owned entries are enforced by ServerSync pushing the server's
  values and by Jötunn's patch on `ConfigEntryBase.SetSerializedValue` (so a local write to a syncable
  entry is blocked / replaced). ConfigurationManager has no admin concept, so it renders those entries
  as ordinary editable fields — there is no lock badge. (An earlier note in this repo claimed the fields
  appear "locked" in the ConfigurationManager window; that was **wrong**.)
- `Jotunn.xml` (shipped with the `JotunnLib` NuGet package) documents the duck-typed
  `ConfigurationManagerAttributes` class embedded in `Jotunn.dll`, including the remark
  *"You can read more and see examples in the readme at
  https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager"* and the statement that
  *"You can optionally remove fields that you won't use from this class"* — i.e. the class is
  matched by shape/name, not by assembly identity.
- `Jotunn.xml` also documents the strictness semantics that the mod relies on:

  > **`AdminOnlyStrictness.Always`** — "AdminOnly is always enforced for Config Entries even if
  > the mod is not installed on the server. This means that AdminOnly configs cannot be edited
  > in multiplayer if the mod is not on the server."
  >
  > **`AdminOnlyStrictness.IfOnServer`** — "AdminOnly is only enforced for Config Entries if the
  > mod is installed on the server."
  >
  > **`SynchronizationModeAttribute`** — "how Jotunn should enforce synchronization of Config
  > Entries. Only relevant for Config Entries that have the
  > `ConfigurationManagerAttributes.IsAdminOnly` applied."

  This is why the plugin uses `[SynchronizationMode(AdminOnlyStrictness.Always)]`: XPortalNetworks
  is `EveryoneMustHaveMod`, so it is always present on the server and the `Always` caveat cannot apply.

## 3. Build and analysis tooling

| Source | Version | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| **AssemblyPublicizer** (CabbageCrow) — <https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer> (binaries: <https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer/releases>) | cached at `tools/.cache/publicizer/AssemblyPublicizer/AssemblyPublicizer.exe` (binary self-reports file version 1.0); LGPL-2.1 (bundled `Licenses/AssemblyPublicizer.LICENSE.txt`) | Publicizing `assembly_valheim`/`_utils`/`_guiutils`/`_postprocessing`; driven by [`tools/New-ValheimRefs.ps1`](tools/README.md) |
| **BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer** — <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer> | — | Documented manual alternative for producing the `_publicized` assemblies (see `.references/README.md`) |
| **ILRepack** (`ILRepack.Lib.MSBuild.Task` 2.0.44.1) — <https://github.com/gluck/il-repack> / <https://www.nuget.org/packages/ILRepack.Lib.MSBuild.Task> | 2.0.44.1 | **No longer used (removed in 3.0.0)** — it existed only to internalize `Vapok.Valheim.Common.dll` into `XPortalNetworks.dll`; with that dependency gone the build is a plain single-assembly MSBuild build (the project no longer imports the package's targets and has no `ILRepack.targets`) |
| **Mono.Cecil** — <https://github.com/jbevain/cecil> | ships in the Jotunn package: `%USERPROFILE%\.nuget\packages\jotunnlib\2.30.2\build\Mono.Cecil.dll` | Reading IL/metadata for API verification (types, members, string literals, attribute arguments) |
| **nuget.exe** — <https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe> | latest (auto-downloaded to `tools/.cache`) | `packages.config` restore in `tools/Build.ps1` |
| **Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies** (+ `.net48`) | 1.0.3 | Compiling against .NET Framework 4.8 without a machine-wide targeting pack |
| **MSBuild** (Visual Studio 18 Community) | local toolchain | Compiling the legacy (non-SDK) csproj |

## 4. Offline documentation and metadata sources

These were the primary ("always reliable") references; all are generated from the
corresponding upstream sources, so they are authoritative rather than summarised:

1. **Library XML API docs on disk** — `<nuget-cache>\<package>\<version>\lib\<tfm>\<Assembly>.xml`
   (e.g. `jotunnlib\2.30.2\lib\net462\Jotunn.xml`; a copy also lands in
   `XPortalNetworks/bin/Release/Jotunn.xml`). Source of every Jotunn/ServerSync statement in this repo.
2. **NuGet package metadata** — `packages.config`, `.nuspec`, and package READMEs
   (the `Vapok.Valheim.Common` README documents "Seamless admin lock enforcement and
   client-server setting replication").
3. **Decompiled IL** of `Jotunn.dll`, `Vapok.Valheim.Common.dll` and the publicized Valheim
   assemblies (via Mono.Cecil) — used whenever docs were silent or ambiguous.
4. **Local Copilot session history** for this repository (Chronicle session store) — earlier
   decisions, build-toolchain findings and version history.

## 5. In-repository prior art

Internal, but they record externally-derived facts and are the source of the versioning and
packaging rules followed here:

- [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) — build + SemVer rules
- [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md) — `Build.ps1` / `New-ValheimRefs.ps1` usage
- [`.references/README.md`](.references/README.md) — reference-assembly layout and provenance
- [`Docs/PATCHNOTES.md`](Docs/PATCHNOTES.md) — release history (e.g. the 2.0.x note recording that
  portal networks/permissions were "synchronized … via Jotunn ServerSync")
- [`Docs/Modules/*.t4`](Docs/Modules) — sources for the generated README configuration sections
- [`Docs/SolutionDir/`](Docs/SolutionDir) — generated README + package manifest

| Item | As referenced in this repo |
|---|---|
| **Advanced Portals** (RandyKnapp) | Integration described in the `DisplayPortalColour` config option |
| **Stone Portal** | Integration described alongside `DisplayPortalColour` |
| **AnyPortal** | Declared incompatible via `[BepInIncompatibility("com.sweetgiorni.anyportal")]` |
| **ValheimCommunityPatch** (MidnightMods) | Compatibility notice in `CHANGELOG.md` (<https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/MidnightMods/ValheimCommunityPatch/>) |
| **XPortal Shared Map Pins** (buldosik) — <https://github.com/buldosik/valheim-mods/tree/master/XPortalSharedMapPins> | Source of the 2.6.0 portal map-pin feature (read 2026-09-29). The standalone companion mod (built against XPortalNetworks 2.0.8, GUID `buldosik.XPortalSharedMapPins`, hard dependency `vapok.mods.xportalnetworks` - the upstream GUID, which 3.0.0 stopped using: this fork registers as `ghostwheel.mods.xportalnetworkstribespins`) was re-implemented as [`PortalMapPins.cs`](XPortalNetworks/PortalMapPins.cs) — so it must **not** be installed alongside 2.6.0+, or the map gets duplicate pins |
| **Nexus Mods** — Nexus ID 3719 / Nexus Update Check | `Mod.Info.NexusId`, `General/NexusID` config key (<https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/102>). A deliberate **reference** to the upstream mod's page (<https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/3719>) — the fork has no Nexus upload of its own — so it is not affected by the 3.0.0 plugin-identity rename |
| **Thunderstore / BepInExPack_Valheim** | Distribution target; BepInEx core source — the pack `denikson-BepInExPack_Valheim-5.4.2350` is built from the `v5-lts` branch of <https://github.com/AzumattDev/BepInEx> (see §2) |

## 7. Source-availability notes

Recorded for transparency about where each fact came from:

- The **web-fetch tool was unavailable** for the whole of the research phase (`fetch_webpage`
  returned *"Thank you for using GitHub Copilot. Your subscription has ended. You are currently
  logged in as ghstwhl."* for every URL, including
  <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager>). The GitHub repository search/index
  tools likewise failed (`github_repo`: *"Github repo index not yet"*) or returned **empty results
  without an error** for valid public repositories. These are GitHub-hosted tools gated by a Copilot
  entitlement, so swapping the model provider does not bring them back — see the next bullet.
- **Web retrieval was restored locally** through a containerized MCP fetch server instead of the
  GitHub-hosted tool: `mcp/fetch` (MCP protocol `2024-11-05`, server `mcp-fetch` 1.23.0) run as
  `docker run -i --rm mcp/fetch`, configured in [`.vscode/mcp.json`](.vscode/mcp.json). MCP servers
  are hosted locally, so they are unaffected by the GitHub entitlement. Verified end-to-end by
  fetching <https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager> — the exact URL that previously
  failed.
- Consequently **every** external fact in §1–§6 was taken from a local primary artifact
  (§1–§4), not from a web page. Where a tool returned an empty result, that was treated
  as *unknown* — never as *"the source does not contain it"*.
- Verified-by-decompilation facts worth naming, because they are not documented upstream in a
  retrievable form: `ConfigEntryBase.BoxedValue` is what ServerSync writes on receipt
  (`ApplyConfigZPackage`); only entries carrying `IsAdminOnly` are collected for synchronisation
  (`GetSyncConfigValues`); a client's change is sent to the server peer
  (`SynchronizeChangedConfig` → `CustomRPC.SendPackage(ZRoutedRpc.GetServerPeerID(), …)`) and the
  server logs *"Received configuration data from client {0}"*; the push is triggered by the
  ConfigurationManager **window being closed** and by `Config_ConfigReloaded`.
- The **XPortal Shared Map Pins** source and the **BepInEx** provenance in §2 were fetched with shell
  `Invoke-WebRequest`/`Invoke-RestMethod` against `raw.githubusercontent.com` and `api.github.com`, because
  the local `mcp/fetch` server refuses GitHub `tree`/`blob` pages (robots.txt) and the GitHub-hosted
  search/index tools return empty results (see above). The Brave-backed web-search MCP server was
  unavailable for this session (`SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN_INVALID`), so nothing here came from a search result.
- The Valheim **map-pin API** used by the 2.6.0 feature — the `Minimap.AddPin`/`RemovePin` signatures,
  `AddPin`'s silent `Icon3` fallback for out-of-range types, its sprite lookup via
  `m_icons.Find(entry => entry.m_name == type)` (and that `Minimap.SpriteData.m_icon` sprites are looked up
  by `Sprite.name`, which is how the game's portal icon is found),
  `m_pins`/`m_icons`/`m_visibleIconTypes`, `Minimap.PinType` (values 0–17, no portal pin type),
  `PinData`/`SpriteData`, and the fact that `Minimap.UpdatePins` re-assigns every marker's
  `m_iconElement.color` on each of its passes — was verified by Mono.Cecil against
  `.references/Valheim/1.0.16/assembly_valheim_publicized.dll`, not read from a web source.

## 8. Attribution and licensing

- **Valheim** and its assemblies are © Iron Gate Studio AB / Coffee Stain Publishing. They are
  used here as compile-time references only and are not redistributed.
- **XPortal Networks** by **Vapok** — <https://github.com/Vapok/XPortalNetworks> — is the base this
  project is built upon and continues (GPL-3.0). Up to 2.6.0 the plugin `GUID`, the plugin `Name` and the
  portal ZDO keys were deliberately identical to it; 3.0.0 gives the fork its own identity
  (`ghostwheel.mods.xportalnetworkstribespins` / `XPortalNetworksTribesPins`) while still *reading* the
  upstream-named config file and ZDO keys (`Mod.Info.LegacyGUID` / `Mod.Info.LegacyName`), so existing
  worlds and configurations keep working. The Nexus reference (ID 3719) deliberately stays the upstream
  mod's page. This project's own home is
  <https://github.com/ghstwhl/XPortalNetworksTribesPins>.
- **XPortal Shared Map Pins** by **buldosik** —
  <https://github.com/buldosik/valheim-mods/tree/master/XPortalSharedMapPins> — is the origin of the map-pin
  feature added in 2.6.0. That repository declares **no licence** (GitHub reports none, and there is no
  `LICENSE` file), so the origin is credited explicitly here: the behaviour was re-implemented inside this
  mod against the vanilla `Minimap` API and this mod's own permission model, instead of the standalone
  mod's reflection adapter.
- **BepInEx**, **HarmonyX**, **Jötunn**, **Mono.Cecil** and **AssemblyPublicizer** each remain under
  their own upstream licences; see the respective links in §2 and §3 for terms. **Vapok.Valheim.Common**
  and **ILRepack** were used up to 2.6.0 and are no longer referenced, merged or distributed as of 3.0.0.
- Note the caveat carried by `tools/New-ValheimRefs.ps1`: XPortalNetworks is **not affiliated**
  with AssemblyPublicizer, and only assemblies you are legally entitled to work with should be
  publicized.
